# Integration Tests

Place assembled-system and cross-boundary tests here. The stable command is:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Use `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`. These tests may exercise multiple workspaces, a real database in a disposable environment, HTTP boundaries, queues, or a browser after the web stack is selected. They must not call paid model APIs; model behavior belongs under `evals/`.

The template's `bootstrap-project.test.mjs` suite lives here because it exercises a complete command through subprocess and filesystem boundaries. Keep tests with comparable cross-boundary behavior under `e2e/`, not in the unit-test command.

The empty template uses Vitest as a stack-neutral integration runner. A product may replace the underlying runner with Playwright or another proven tool, but it must preserve the `npm run e2e` command.
