# Bootstrap Checklist

The preferred path from `onee-workspace` is:

```bash
make create-product name=my-product
```

That command creates and clones the GitHub repository, runs this template's bootstrap script, verifies the project, publishes the initialized commit, and registers the clone with the local workspace.

When creating a repository directly through GitHub's template interface, initialize it locally with:

```bash
npm run bootstrap -- --name my-product
```

Use `--scope <scope>` or `--title <title>` to override values derived from the project name. Re-running bootstrap with the same identity is safe; it refuses to overwrite custom workspace package names.

## Repository

- Choose whether `apps/web` should use Next.js, Vite, Astro, Remix, or another stack.
- Add required environment variables to `.env.example`.

## GitHub

- Make the repository public or private according to project needs.
- Enable **Template repository** only for repositories meant to be reused as templates.
- Add branch protection or repository rulesets.
- Require the `Quality` workflow before merging.
- Configure model credentials only in the protected `Model Eval` workflow.
- Decide whether model evals are required for main, releases, or manual acceptance.
- Configure other required secrets and environments.
- Decide whether releases are manual, tag-based, or automated.

## Local

```bash
npm run prepare
npm run check
```
