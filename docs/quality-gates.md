# Quality Gates

The default deterministic quality gate is:

```text
lint -> test -> e2e
```

Run each deterministic gate explicitly:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run e2e
```

Run the real-model gate explicitly:

```bash
npm run eval
```

## Command Contracts

| Command        | Contract                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run lint` | Deterministic static checks: formatting, ESLint, and TypeScript. It must not call external services.                                 |
| `npm run test` | Fast unit tests for isolated functions, modules, and components. External systems and models should be replaced at their boundaries. |
| `npm run e2e`  | Integration tests across assembled application boundaries such as HTTP, database, queues, or browser flows.                          |
| `npm run eval` | Evaluations that call real models against representative inputs and explicit scoring thresholds.                                     |

The quality gates are deliberately not aggregated under another script. Keeping them explicit makes local, bootstrap, and CI behavior visible. Model evals remain separate because they require protected credentials, can incur cost, and may be non-deterministic. `npm run build` remains available as a separate packaging/deployment check.

The template includes an integration test for its bootstrap command. Its stack-neutral application runner may still report no Vitest suites until an application stack exists. The empty `eval` suite intentionally fails: a project cannot claim that `npm run eval` passed until it defines and runs real-model evaluations. Concrete projects should add application integration suites and model evals as soon as those boundaries exist.

## CI Gate

The `Quality` workflow runs deterministic gates on push and pull request:

```text
checkout
-> setup node
-> npm install
-> npm run lint
-> npm run test
-> npm run e2e
```

The separate `Model Eval` workflow runs `npm run eval` only by manual dispatch in the generic template. Its job is bound to the `model-eval` GitHub Environment. Configure that environment to allow only `main`, add approval when appropriate, and store model credentials as environment secrets. Keep model credentials out of repository-level secrets and untrusted pull-request workflows. When a provider is selected, make missing credentials fail clearly, then decide whether to add protected `main` or release triggers.

Add project-specific implementation behind the stable commands when the stack is chosen:

- Playwright or another proven browser runner behind `npm run e2e`
- the selected model provider and evaluation harness behind `npm run eval`
- Database migration checks
- Docker image build
- Release validation
- Lighthouse or bundle-size checks
